## Overview

This project implements a web-based heart attack prediction system using Python and Flask. Users can input various health metrics such as age, cholesterol levels, exercise habits, etc., and get an instant prediction whether they are at high or low risk of a heart attack.

The application uses a machine learning model trained on a dataset to predict heart attack risks. Predictions are displayed in real-time on the user interface.

## Features

- Predicts the risk of a heart attack based on user input.
- User-friendly web interface for data input and result display.
- Uses a Random Forest Classifier model trained with historical data.
- Built with Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and integrates with scikit-learn for machine learning.

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/heart-attack-prediction.git
   cd heart-attack-prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**

   Start the Flask development server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to view the application.

## Usage

1. **Input Form:**

   - Fill out the form with relevant health and lifestyle information.
   - Click on the "Predict" button to submit the data.

2. **Prediction Display:**

   - After submission, the application will display whether the user is at high or low risk of a heart attack based on the input data.

3. **Interpretation:**

   - The prediction result will indicate either "high risk" or "low risk" based on the machine learning model's prediction.
